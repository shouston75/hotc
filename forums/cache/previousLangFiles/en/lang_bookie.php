<p>Input the time in this form: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and the hour is based on the 24-hour clock (army time).  So 14:00 would be 2:00PM. <br /> </p>", 
'spread_explained_input_winners' => "<br />

<p>Remember to take the game's spread into consideration (if there is in fact a spread for that particular game).<br /> </p>

<p>For example: If Indianapolis is favored and the spread is 3 points, then they would need to win by 3 or more points for them to technically <i>win</i> in ibBookie.<br /> </p>

<p>If Indianapolis only wins by 2 points, then you should input the OTHER team as the winner, since they covered their spread (lost by less than 3 points). <br /> </p>",

'spread_explained' => "<br /> 

<p>-The Spread input is for the HOME TEAM.  IF you input a Spread number (totally optional), the system will make it the Home Team Spread, and will make the Away Team Spread the inverse.<br /> </p>

<p>-In other words, if Home Team is the favorite, and you want to make the spread 3 points, you would input -3 because they would then need to win by 4 to cover the -3 spread.  And the system will auto-assign 3 (positive) to the AWAY Team Spread.<br /></p>",

'payout_odds_explained' => "<br />	

<p>-Input the Payout Odds if desired, it is <strong>not required</strong> however.<br />	</p>

<p>-This value determines the payout for a win.  It's the factor that <strong>the wager is multiplied by to create the total amount to win</strong>. <br /></p>

<p>-For an underdog that pays 2 to 1 you would input the number 2.  In other words, that team is only half as likely to win as the opposing team.  Thus anyone gutsy enough to pick them should get double the points.  <br /></p>

<p>-For an underdog that is a big longshot, lets say 5 to 1, you would enter the number 5 which means the bettor will win 5 times his wager if his underdog wins.  <br /></p>

<p>-And conversely, for a favored team, input a decimal number.  So if you input .5 for Team X, if Team X wins any user who picked them will win half their bet in profit.  <br /></p>

<p>-You have 4 options:<br /><br />
--->Leave both Payout Odds blank, so the game is straight 1 to 1 odds for both teams.<br /><br />
--->Input a Payout Odd for Home Team, and the system will automatically calculate the Payout Odd for the Away Team for you.<br /><br />
--->Same as above, but vice versa (input Away Team only, system takes care of Home Team).<br /><br />
--->Be crazy and input unrelating Payout Odds for both teams.  Its your board, your rules eh. <br /><br /></p>",
